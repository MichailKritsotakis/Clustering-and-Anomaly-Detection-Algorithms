# Clustering-and-Anomaly-Detection-Algorithms
In this project we work with a dataset which provides information about the duration and time of usage of a kettle for one month. We aim to find routines of usage, their periodicities and variabilities. We use a clustering algorithm to group the data and find routines. We then visualize the distribution of the clusters we found. Finally, we use the isolation forest algorithm to detect outliers for each of the found clusters.
